# Dancing

##
I dance wen belle sweet me. I dance wen things rough. I dance wen na only me one dey. I dance wen i dey vex.

##
My teacher say "stay one place! no dance everywhere for the full day".

##
But my mama talk say "Dance go make you strong. Dance go stretch you. One day you go be dancer. You go shock everybody".

##
I tell myself say "One day i got sabi dance well well and people go pay to look my stepping. Dem go say...e sabi dance no be small ".
