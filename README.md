# asp-new - New translations of stories for African Storybook

This repository consists of newly commissioned translations of [African Storybook](http://www.africanstorybook.org/) stories that have not yet been submitted through the official website and therefore have not yet been added to the [ASP Source](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-source) repository.

## Background

One-off translations into ASP-supported languages (e.g., English, French, Swahili, Lugbarati, etc.) are usually added manually to the African Storybook website and then included in the ASP Source repository once they have been published. However, African Storybook does not currently have any means of batch uploading new translations in text format. This repository is therefore a holding area for new translations that have been commissioned but are waiting to be manually submitted to the African Storybook site.
